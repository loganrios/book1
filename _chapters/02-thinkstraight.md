"Yeah, I know that color. Called 'I-hate-my-dad red'. Rocked it for my whole junior year in high school while *he* was out in New Mexico. Went blonde the day he came home." She cracked her knuckles and smoothed out her eyebrows. "Had too much fun since to go back."

An immaculately french-tipped middle finger looped up and around the silicone Pop Socket attached to a Kate Spade phone case, housing a two-generations old iPhone with an aftermarket rose-gold body and eggshell-white face. Edges of prints dotted outside the screen, only visible from the exact angle of beaming sunlight at which her 'conversation' partner sat.

"So definitely way too old to still hate her dad." Max rested his elbow on the glass drawing desk, his joint slipping in discomfort against the cold surface, and held his head in the extended flattened palm. "Shoot. Well, I'm sure he's in there right now figuring *that* out. Shame that she came so far just to leave."

"Twenty-four, twenty-five?" Kiki pursed her lips for the brief moment that she looked up from her rhythm game to size up the other occupant of Edgar's closed office, before rushing right back down. Her phone made one little non-musical noise, a testament to the speed of the glance. "Maybe she just doesn't know. Could've been jealous of somebody with that hair color back as a teenager, and just wanted to try it out now."

Max moved his head off his palm and half-pointed towards the office. "Nuh-uh. Look at the way she shifts her weight on her hips when she talks. That girl absolutely hates her dad." His arm fell to land his palm on the desk.

"You can't tell something like that just from how someone stands... jeez, ninety-nine point five, so close!" Kiki grumbled, pressed her phone twice again before dropping it from her grip in impotent frustration, where the soft case muffled the clatter onto the glass. She looked up at Max with an eyebrow raised. "Wait, can you?"

"Oh yeah. Easy." He sat up and extended his hands parallel to each other and motioned a gentle curve. "See, when you're held by your dad as a baby-slash-toddler, he doesn't have a natural 'shelf' on his hips like mothers do, so you develop muscles around your pelvis that keep you upright without any direct support. But, if he's not around so much--troubled relationship, see," Max gestured a bigger curve, "you always have pelvic support, meaning that those muscles never quite develop the same. Hence why, when girls with troubled paternal relationships try to stand for long stretches, they have to shift their weight back and forth constantly to stay comfortable."

Kiki bit her cheek. "Wouldn't that mean boys have the same issue?"

"They would, if their hips grew outwards. More testosterone means that our central column of balance get more reinforcement through puberty, rather than less." Max stood and smoothed a hand down his own left side, incidentally revealing a wrinkle in his dress pants.

"Hmph. Doesn't sound real." Kiki picked her phone back up, vertically this time, and, after a few more pokes, started typing furiously with her thumbs; a plastic pitter-patter of sixteenth notes. "Curse. It's so hard to type with the new nails."

"New research, so probably not on the big sites yet." Max's voice raised by a half-tone before he caught himself. "And didn't you say you hated long nails? You know, that tirade you went on after we closed the contract with your favorite trashy mall sales--"

The door to the Edgar's office swung open, the click from the hinge deafening the ambience of their conversation. Max's back yanked up like the inverse of the patterned snap bracelets that were littered behind Kiki's laptop. Kiki herself clicked her phone to sleep and quietly tossed it into a nearby tote.

"Everyone!" Edgar smiled across the room to the two legacies. He kept exactly one pace ahead of the stranger, his stride long and confident. "I want you to meet Jerika Jensen, the newest member of the team. She's going to be interning here for the summer, hopefully with the goal of getting hired on full-time provided our workload increases-as-projected toward the end of the fiscal year. Oh, and that she likes working here, of course." He gave a professional chuckle, then turned towards his guest of honor. "Do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself?"

The new girl paused for a moment, bit her lip, and took one hand off the backpack she held in front of her, held it forward, then  retreated it back. "Er... I'm--"

"JJ!" Kiki whispered excitedly under her breath.

"No." A brief groan escaped and her eyes started to roll before she corrected herself back into proper posture. "Or rather, just 'Jerika' is fine. I'm going to be working here. With you guys."

Three seconds passed. Max folded his arms. Kiki tapped her nails on the table. Edgar looked expectant, making little circles with his wrist. "You want to... tell them where you're from?"

"Utah. North Utah. Really north. Cache Valley, if you've heard of it." Jerika nodded. "Um, big family. Eight kids. I'm the oldest."

"Sounds like Utah, alright!" Another professional chuckle from Edgar, facing towards the silent observers. "Family is important at the Mathews Group, so no worries. Kiki's my daughter, and Max's fiancee is her mother's youngest cousin." He rubbed his jaw and turned back to her. "Hopefully not *too* much pressure to be our first hire based purely on merit."

Imperceptible to the other participants, Max grit his teeth.

"Max says you hate your dad." Kiki spoke plainly, with the cadence of feigned ignorance.

Edgar shot a disappointed look.

"Whoa, whoa, I didn't *say* that, exactly." Max put a hand over his heart. "Honest to God, forgive us for just joking around a little. Kiki doesn't meet new people too much, and I thought it would help her be less worried about the whole thing."

Her father shrugged and nodded. 

Kiki turned and raised that same eyebrow from earlier even higher back in his direction before turning back. "Well, do you?"

"No?" Jerika looked confused and embarrassed. "At least, I don't think so? I could only really talk once or twice a month during college. But he was around more when I was super little and my mom was traveling for work."

"Huh." Kiki leaned back in her chair and clicked a pen from her desk forcefully in Max's direction. He averted her gaze.

"Wow, lots of personal questions. But, you can see, we try to foster deeper connections with all people here at the Group, especially our clients." Edgar clapped his hands, then pointed towards the charcoal-suited figure in the defensive pose. "Notwithstanding bizarre attempts to placate our introverted assistant, Max Fischer here is my right-hand man. I'm volunteering him to show you the ropes."

Jerika nodded, apparently relieved.

"Er, actually, Boss... but Moffet is a pretty hot fire right now, and I'm worried it'd be a little technical for a beginner especially if we still want it collated before the weekend." Max grimaced. "Nothing personal, Jerika--the Hamalta contract next week should be straightforward enough to even take on yourself, if you want it."

"That's fine, totally fine." Jerika waved a hand and nodded.

"Hmm." Edgar narrowed his eyes, just subtle enough and angled away from the new intern, before producing a small notebook from his jacket pocket and flicking through dogeared pages. "Sorry buddy, but I'm tied up in hunting for new work until my last podcast interview wraps up at 7PM on Friday. Have to make sure that we can eat for the holidays. I'm sure *you* can find a way to make it happen."

"And, if I can say..." Jerika leaned forward a bit. "I can help out with any sort of annoying tedious stuff. Teenage me loved doing end-of-month paperwork for my Dad's shop, just filling out forms for hours."

"Hey, there you go--aren't most of Moffet's records still on dead trees, anyway?" Edgar placed his notebook back in his pocket and gave Jerika a thumbs-up. "Kiki, can you call them and make sure they're expecting two of us, today? Whenever you get a moment."

Kiki, by this point, was already back on her now-horizontal phone, but hummed a melodically confirmatory "mhm".

Max shuffled his feet and shifted his weight to the other hip. "I mean, it's a lot of paper, but she doesn't even know how we figured out what to start looking for--"

"You can take the Lexus, if you want." Edgar tossed the keyfob onto Kiki's desk. "The drive up has a curvy forest path that never has any traffic in the afternoon. All good? I'm two minutes late for my next call."

"Deal." Max snatched the fob like a starving rat.

Edgar snapped his fingers. "Great. Keep up the good work. Hope you have a good first day, Jerika! Let me know how he does." He slipped into his office, and the door clicked once more.

Jerika Jensen, 24, and recently rejected from the FBI's internship program, looked worriedly at the closed wooden door of the office, then looked back at the smug, evil expression on Max's face as he stared at the fob in-hand while the hail-on-window-esque tapping of Kiki's rhythm game bounced around in her head. The heels she had picked were not meant for standing all morning, she was now learning. Her grip on the leather straps of her backpack tightened, and she very much tried to exhale calmly.
