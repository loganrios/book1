"Yeah, I know that color. Called 'I-hate-my-dad red'. Rocked it for my whole junior year in high school while *he* was out in New Mexico. Went blonde the day he came home." She cracked her knuckles and smoothed out her eyebrows. "Had too much fun since to go back."

An immaculately french-tipped middle finger looped up and around the silicone Pop Socket attached to a Kate Spade phone case, housing a two-generations old iPhone with an aftermarket rose-gold body and eggshell-white face. Edges of prints dotted outside the screen, only visible from the exact angle of beaming sunlight at which her 'conversation' partner sat.

"So definitely way too old to still hate her dad." Max rested his elbow on the glass drawing desk, his joint slipping in discomfort against the cold surface, and held his head in the extended flattened palm. "Shoot. Well, I'm sure he's in there right now figuring *that* out. Shame that she came so far just to leave."

"Twenty-four, twenty-five?" Kiki pursed her lips for the brief moment that she looked up from her rhythm game to size up the other occupant of Edgar's closed office, before rushing right back down. Her phone made one little non-musical noise, a testament to the speed of the glance. "Maybe she just doesn't know. Could've been jealous of somebody with that hair color back as a teenager, and just wanted to try it out now."

Max moved his head off his palm and half-pointed towards the office. "Nuh-uh. Look at the way she shifts her weight on her hips when she talks. That girl absolutely hates her dad." His arm fell to land his palm on the desk.

"You can't tell something like that just from how someone stands... jeez, ninety-nine point five, so close!" Kiki grumbled, pressed her phone twice again before dropping it from her grip in impotent frustration, where the soft case muffled the clatter onto the glass. She looked up at Max with an eyebrow raised. "Wait, can you?"

"Oh yeah. Easy." He sat up and extended his hands parallel to each other and motioned a gentle curve. "See, when you're held by your dad as a baby-slash-toddler, he doesn't have a natural 'shelf' on his hips like mothers do, so you develop muscles around your pelvis that keep you upright without any direct support. But, if he's not around so much--troubled relationship, see," Max gestured a bigger curve, "you always have pelvic support, meaning that those muscles never quite develop the same. Hence why, when girls with troubled paternal relationships try to stand for long stretches, they have to shift their weight back and forth constantly to stay comfortable."

Kiki bit her cheek. "Wouldn't that mean boys have the same issue?"

"They would, if their hips grew outwards. More testosterone means that our central column of balance get more reinforcement through puberty, rather than less." Max stood and smoothed a hand down his own left side, incidentally revealing a wrinkle in his dress pants.

"Hmph. Doesn't sound real." Kiki picked her phone back up, vertically this time, and, after a few more pokes, started typing furiously with her thumbs; a plastic pitter-patter of sixteenth notes. "Curse. It's so hard to type with the new nails."

"New research, so probably not on the big sites yet." Max's voice raised by a half-tone before he caught himself. "And didn't you say you hated long nails? You know, that tirade you went on after we closed the contract with your favorite trashy mall sales--"

The door to the Edgar's office swung open, the click from the hinge deafening the ambience of their conversation. Max's back yanked up like the inverse of the patterned snap bracelets that were littered behind Kiki's laptop. Kiki herself clicked her phone to sleep and quietly tossed it into a nearby tote.

"Everyone!" Edgar smiled across the room to the two legacies. He kept exactly one pace ahead of the stranger, his stride long and confident. "I want you to meet Jerika Jensen, the newest member of the team. She's going to be interning here for the summer, hopefully with the goal of getting hired on full-time provided our workload increases-as-projected toward the end of the fiscal year. Oh, and that she likes working here, of course." He gave a professional chuckle, then turned towards his guest of honor. "Do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself?"

The new girl paused for a moment, bit her lip, and took one hand off the backpack she held in front of her, held it forward, then  retreated it back. "Er... I'm--"

"JJ!" Kiki whispered excitedly under her breath.

"No." A brief groan escaped and her eyes started to roll before she corrected herself back into proper posture. "Or rather, just 'Jerika' is fine. I'm going to be working here. With you guys."

Three seconds passed. Max folded his arms. Kiki tapped her nails on the table. Edgar looked expectant, making little circles with his wrist. "You want to... tell them where you're from?"

"Utah. North Utah. Really north. Cache Valley, if you've heard of it." Jerika nodded. "Um, big family. Eight kids. I'm the oldest."

"Sounds like Utah, alright!" Another professional chuckle from Edgar, facing towards the silent observers. "Family is important at the Mathews Group, so no worries. Kiki's my daughter, and Max's fiancee is her mother's youngest cousin." He rubbed his jaw and turned back to her. "Hopefully not *too* much pressure to be our first hire based purely on merit."

Imperceptible to the other participants, Max grit his teeth.

"Max says you hate your dad." Kiki spoke plainly, with the cadence of feigned ignorance.

Edgar shot a disappointed look.

"Whoa, whoa, I didn't *say* that, exactly." Max put a hand over his heart. "Honest to God, forgive us for just joking around a little. Kiki doesn't meet new people too much, and I thought it would help her be less worried about the whole thing."

Her father shrugged and nodded. 

Kiki turned and raised that same eyebrow from earlier even higher back in his direction before turning back. "Well, do you?"

"No?" Jerika looked confused and embarrassed. "At least, I don't think so? I could only really talk once or twice a month during college. But he was around more when I was super little and my mom was traveling for work."

"Huh." Kiki leaned back in her chair and clicked a pen from her desk forcefully in Max's direction. He averted her gaze.

"Wow, lots of personal questions. But, you can see, we try to foster deeper connections with all people here at the Group, especially our clients." Edgar clapped his hands, then pointed towards the charcoal-suited figure in the defensive pose. "Notwithstanding bizarre attempts to placate our introverted assistant, Max Fischer here is my right-hand man. I'm volunteering him to show you the ropes."

Jerika nodded, apparently relieved.

"Er, actually, Boss... but Moffet is a pretty hot fire right now, and I'm worried it'd be a little technical for a beginner especially if we still want it collated before the weekend." Max grimaced. "Nothing personal, Jerika--the Hamalta contract next week should be straightforward enough to even take on yourself, if you want it."

"That's fine, totally fine." Jerika waved a hand and nodded.

"Hmm." Edgar narrowed his eyes, just subtle enough and angled away from the new intern, before producing a small notebook from his jacket pocket and flicking through dogeared pages. "Sorry buddy, but I'm tied up in hunting for new work until my last podcast interview wraps up at 7PM on Friday. Have to make sure that we can eat for the holidays. I'm sure *you* can find a way to make it happen."

"And, if I can say..." Jerika leaned forward a bit. "I can help out with any sort of annoying tedious stuff. Teenage me loved doing end-of-month paperwork for my Dad's shop, just filling out forms for hours."

"Hey, there you go--aren't most of Moffet's records still on dead trees, anyway?" Edgar placed his notebook back in his pocket and gave Jerika a thumbs-up. "Kiki, can you call them and make sure they're expecting two of us, today? Whenever you get a moment."

Kiki, by this point, was already back on her now-horizontal phone, but hummed a melodically confirmatory "mhm".

Max shuffled his feet and shifted his weight to the other hip. "I mean, it's a lot of paper, but she doesn't even know how we figured out what to start looking for--"

"You can take the Lexus, if you want." Edgar tossed the keyfob onto Kiki's desk. "The drive up has a curvy forest path that never has any traffic in the afternoon. All good? I'm two minutes late for my next call."

"Deal." Max snatched the fob like a starving rat.

Edgar snapped his fingers. "Great. Keep up the good work. Hope you have a good first day, Jerika! Let me know how he does." He slipped into his office, and the door clicked once more.

Jerika Jensen, 24, and recently rejected from the FBI's internship program, looked worriedly at the closed wooden door of the office, then looked back at the smug, evil expression on Max's face as he stared at the fob in-hand while the hail-on-window-esque tapping of Kiki's rhythm game bounced around in her head. The heels she had picked were not meant for standing all morning, she was now learning. Her grip on the leather straps of her backpack tightened, and she very much tried to exhale calmly.

The trees, just barely sparse as summer wound down, rustled in patterns of green waves that rippled above and across the bisecting road. The tires of the Lexus glided over the fresh, black asphalt, the sunlight filtering through in concentrated spots, making the road a veritable country night sky in broad daylight. 

Jerika stared out the passenger window towards the dual heavens.

He hadn't stopped talking the whole time. Would that she could go back in time and ask a more narrow question than "what is it that we do, here, anyway"; it wasn't the lack of helpful information, it was the lack of gaps.

"And now, of course, you're thinking: that doesn't sound like traditional auditing. You're right! Co-opting that moniker was more of a bid for legitimacy than an actual description, but it's less egregious than you think. Plenty of certifications require what was already called an 'audit', well-outside the definition of whatever CPAs think that means. I'm correct in guessing that you are not a CPA?"

She shook her head, one full shake, but he apparently caught the first tenth-of-a-radian of rotation in peripheral vision, and barreled onwards before she'd even completed the movement. She still wasn't facing him.

"Yep, that's on purpose. Edgar's a CPA, and I failed the test once, which might've got us in the door, but neither of us have done anything like that in the past year. Why? It makes the most sense once you *really* understand what happened to the feds in Telluride two years ago. Not just what the media told you."

Jerika sat back and double-checked her seatbelt, finally glancing over at him. "Wait, what happened in Telluride? Was I supposed to know?"

Max frowned. "It's the *whole reason* companies like us exist right now. You don't remember? It was national news for two whole days."

Her forehead creased as she pressed her thumb to her right temple. "Is that the one where the tiger seal escaped and then ate a couple rafters? What does that have to do with anything?"

"Of course, everyone focuses on the tiger seal, just 'cause it's gruesome." He rolled his eyes. "Four years ago, before they had even acquired the tiger seal, one of the department's employees, Pace Albright, was having trouble showing up to work on time, so he--"

"Speed check reported ahead," spoke the car's speakers in crisp, ominous surround sound.

"Shoot. Shoot shoot shoot." The Lexus pulled over in the half-lane-sized roadside. Max flung off his seatbelt and shoved open the door, a whoosh of damp, warm air blowing back Jerika's curls, the engine settling into an auto-stop.

Eyes widening and blood pumping, she rapidly undid her own seatbelt and peered through the open door. "What's happening? What's wrong?"

"You gotta switch me." 

"Switch you? I've never driven this thing before. I don't know how it works!"

"It's a car!" Max waved at the wheel, then pointed down the road. "See that black dot at the turn of the corner? He's right up ahead. And if we wait long enough here, then he's gonna see that people are trading places, probably to avoid him, and we're gonna get in a lot of trouble. So, please--"

"Look, Edgar gave *you* the keys. Why can't you just drive?" Jerika folded her arms. "You one of those weirdos that's scared of cops for no reason? Just drive normally, we'll be fine."

Max threw up both of his hands. "Aren't you an intern? Can't you just trust me?"

"Nuh-uh. Something smells fishy to me." Jerika squinted her eyes.

"Jeez... fine." Max exhaled and leaned against the open driver-side doorframe. "I got a DUI. One-time thing. Dry now. But recent. I can't get pulled over driving."

"Does Edgar know?"

"He... knows that I bike most places. And there are health benefits to bike commuting, which I've also explained to him."

"So he doesn't know." Jerika sighed. "Look, I'll drive, but for the rest of the trip. And--hey, I see you doing that, no, not a chance--you can make your case at the DMV or whatever. I'm not gonna be an accomplice."

The switch was tense and silent, save for the chorus of squawking birds above and the whistle of the branches. Yet not even a single bug was visible on the car or the road as they moved to their new positions.

Max pulled the passenger door shut, dabbing the sweat around his collar with the back of his hand. As the car purred back into motion, a lightbulb seemed to go off, and both eyebrows briefly bounced, uncaught by the new driver. "I understand that was a real miscall by myself back there. Hoping it doesn't damage our professional relationship."

"Mm." Her eyes were locked straight ahead. She drove a little faster than Max, though the wheel turned slower along its circular path than in his hands.

"That being said, if you feel obligated to inform Edgar that I have a DUI and that you no longer wish to continue working under me, then I could not fault you."

"I'll think about it." She paused, as if her automatic response made her realize that she would need to think about it. "But I'm not here to give up easily."

"Glad to hear it." He was not.

HB Moffet Inc had some growing pains. While the actual process of logistic support for Italian exports had remained much the same in the last 30 years, the competitive landscape had revolutionized *twice* in the past five alone. 

The current CEO, James Barron Moffet, had paid his dues for inheriting the family's century-old business for thirty years before the board finally voted him into office, but the decision had been primarily motivated by fear. The virtual monopoly Moffet held over Italian export logistics was not tyrannical; they'd always offered fair prices, welcomed clients of all degrees of sophistication, and had a nearly-flawless reputation for customer service. This, they thought, was all that the Eastern US manufacturing market needed, until ITALIA! showed up and ruined everything.

ITALIA! (exclamation point *sic*) was nothing like Moffet. Their employees wore jeans and hoodies to work. Their offices were sparse, open spaces littered with Lifetime tables and metal folding chairs, rented from no-name landlords in places as gauche as the second floor of an outdoor mall. Their Founder CEO tweeted *memes*, for crying out loud. So nobody, including direct competitor Moffet, took them seriously, until they raised Series C funding and, one fiscal year later, miraculously shattered the entire industry's revenue cap.

Thus, James Barron Moffet, feeling the watchful gaze of a very terrified board anticipating drastic solutions, acquired ITALIA! without a second thought. And the monopoly was restored.

Except, Moffet's new CEO knew very little about how ITALIA! actually worked, and that the Italian export logistics industry had changed since the days of his great-granduncle HB Moffet. And now, undercurrents spake of ITALIA!'s remnant talent splitting off and re-claiming their glory.

"And new-guy JB's not going to have any of that, which is why it's our job to come in, and show that the ex-ITALIA! folks can't be trusted," Max explained, running his fingers over the dusty leather of the ringed books in this dark, moldy room. A single naked light, attached by a chain, dangled from the split boards in the ceiling. "So if we can find a letter of receipt without each of the two required stamps, we'll be golden. Easy money."

"Does it say that in the contract?" Jerika coughed, the dust filling her lungs every time she stepped and a new cloud billowed in the skinny aisles. "That we're trying to get rid of those guys?"

<!-- 09 Aug 2024: 1300 words -->

"Not strictly," Max pulled out one of the boxes whose stickered date had worn partially off, "but that's why we do research on these companies as part of our service package." He had smiled when he saw the illegible date marking, and it grew when he didn't see a title page at the front of the first binder.

"You said that we're contracted to determine if a company is... whew, hold on a second--is following its own internal policy." Jerika, nearly out-of-breath, sat down on the few inches available on the metal shelving in front of the cubes. "And it sure sounds like what you're saying is not what they're asking for in the contract, and therefore not what we're being paid to do."

"*Au contrare*. Cough cough." A particular page's particles flew straight up into his nostrils. "The contract is the vehicle by which they pay us for what they *actually* want, just like how the policy is the vehicle by which they punish people they don't like."

"So a contract is not the actual agreement, and the policy is not the actual rules for working."

"Precisely."

"Hmm." Her breathing was louder than the acknowledgment, and she fell to a kneel on the floor. "Seems cynical."

"Then you're not seeing the... wait, let me..." Max flipped through a few more binders, before finding one that looked just a little fresher than all the others--meaning that only one corner wasn't frayed. "A-ha! Like this, see?"

"What?" She squinted at the page. "There's a physical signature on the first line, but not on the second. But both are labeled with the digital signature of the required parties. Clearly someone just forgot."

"No, no. Take a step back, first." Max flipped over several pages, each displaying the two physical and two digital signatures at the bottom of the tables. "Your question should be *why* they ever required two signatures on this form."

"I don't know!" Jerika shrugged. "Bureaucracy. That's just the way it is. Nonsense like this happens in 'the system'."

Max chuckled. "You dear, sweet, naive intern." He browsed back to the page with the missing physical signature. "One of the rules of the business world is that everything, at some point, was a *decision* made by *someone*. And that 'someone' made the actual decision to require two different types of signatures on the same form--possibly even acknowledging the redundancy."

"So? Maybe they just weren't thinking that hard."

"No, *no*." There was some grit in his voice as he held up his index finger. "You can't *assume* that. Never assume that anything was due to laziness or incompetence. That means you'll be forgiving,  maybe even empathetic, and being empathetic is the worst possible trait you can have as an auditor. You have to assume that everyone is *evil*."

"Again, cynical." She massaged her temples, before standing back up and yanking out another dusty box. "So what's the 'evil' reason behind the dual signatures? Do you actually know?"

"Yes, that's why we're here. And you can stop bringing out boxes--I found the one."

"Great." She groaned and lifted the last box back into place. "Glad we've been doing this for two hours, just for this one bit."

"In 2007, when this particular form was introduced, the COO Macy Moffet was worried about their relationship with their office supplies retailer--if the Moffet warehouse didn't order enough pens every month, they would lose their Gold client status, which meant that all the executives in the nice offices on the upper floors would pay double for printer ink. Macy Moffet herself had sat in on a meeting where management was pushing using Blackberries and laptops for executive communication, and was frustrated that everybody was moving to emailing PDFs, which she couldn't figure out at the time, instead of printing and handing her colorful paper. So, when this supplier's contract came up for renewal, she demonstrated to the board that buying less pens would blow up the supply costs to the white-collar office--of course, failing to mention that everybody was gradually using less printer ink. Thus, the board magically felt that physical signatures provided a valuable defense against imagined rumors of digital forgery, and thus required *two* signatures."

Jerika had already started putting the other boxes away as he rambled, huffing and puffing under the heft of each. "Meaning that this $40,000 order was invalidated because some executive didn't like PDFs?"

"Two for two. You're catching on."

"And you're making the broader point that anything, including projections and rules, can be made up by people who happen to be looking out for their own interests. While also not helping me put away the boxes that you had me drag out just to make this point."

"It seemed like good character-building. Y'know, internships and all."

Jerika exhaled, then wiped the sweat off her forehead. "Seems like a pretty bad way. Lots of lying."

Max shrugged and stifled a grin. "It's hard to be in the game. Some people can't put aside enough of their conscience to play. Can't be too attached to deal with it all. But the money's good. And don't you like money? Everybody does."

"Maybe." She brushed the dust off her knees, grabbed the portfolio out of Max's hands, shoved it into the box, and then shoved the box itself away. "You made your point. What's next?"

"A meeting that you're now in the exact right mindset for." Max swung open the creaky door, flicked off the lights, and ushered the exasperated intern into the hallway.
