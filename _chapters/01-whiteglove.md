"Look, I know _you_ think saying that 'you have nothing to hide' is both correct and disarming. Everybody who says that is betting on the fantasy that people like me will be so dumbfounded by your openness and honestly that we'll magically take our jobs less seriously. And I'll tell you, what sucks is that saying you had 'nothing to hide' probably was once an unprecedented display of virtue! Allowing the world to examine your trail and find that there was nothing but clarity and goodness all along... I'm certain in an earlier age, more of us would listen to that signal."

"Well, it's still true in my case."

The two stood in what might've once been a garage, until the door had been ripped off and the outer walls suffered a plastering of pixel-visible stock photos depicting agriculture idyllica in a vision of what a non-DMV resident might've supposed DMV-area farms looked like--and such a vision would be choked out in the unbearable mug the moment one stepped out of any vehicle that bothered to stop in the DMV. 

Children were laughing outside, their hands running through the leaves of the unfruited plants that lazily flopped up through the soil and wire held together by reclaimed palette wood. A cicada flew in from the outside, made a clumsy u-turn around in the shade of the interior, and flew right back out.

Max grit his teeth as he thumbed through even more yellowed paper stuffed haphazardly in the dismounted kitchen cabinets. He'd be getting paper cuts in his haste if the pages weren't already so thin and falling apart. "Okay, but you understand that if you _were_ hiding something, that'd still be one of the more optimal things to say to me, right? Since it'd be weirder to either be silent or be overly inquisitive about what I'm looking at. You saying that to me means nothing, and in fact it means less than nothing. It means you think so little of me that saying _that_ would influence my behavior."

Gloria Greene, Senior Equipment Custodian of the Midwestern Piracy And Intellectual Property Theft division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and dressed in dirt-covered overalls and braids unbecoming of a woman of her career status, let out an exasperated sigh and shrugged her shoulders. "I'll admit I'm more used to auditors asking me questions _before_ doling out the morality sermons and pearl-clutching over offenses I've caused."

Max Fischer, former Junior Accountant at the FBI (for a whole eight months), yanked open a rigid wooden drawer, spraining his knuckles and embedding blisters into his fingerprints. He didn't feel the sting until a few seconds later, then grimaced through the pain. "Then you might want to double-check their incentives. Feigning timidity while gathering evidence is a solid strategy when I think I might still need to ask for money or favors."

Birds were chirping. A deliberate hand rang the bell twice outside the garage, and a hushed voice whispered to a child that the cashier would be on her way.

Gloria smiled. "And you're sure that you won't care about what I, being one of the people that will report on your performance as a contractor, will say about your brazenly marching up to a non-profit that I volunteer labor for _strictly_ off-the-clock and demanding access to our records when I could be helping the hungry folks outside? You don't care about currying my favor, when I've already done so much and could probably just kick you out right now?"

"No. I do not." Tilting his head, Max kicked around a few cardboard boxes and listened to the shaking contents. "And you can wait for our investigation to finish, or you can give me thirty more seconds of talking. Either way, you'll learn why."

Max spotted the jet-black Lexus parked haphazardly on the street, and when he closed his eyes, he could just make out the soft purr of its German engine. The asphalt baked the bottom of his shoes, and with each step he nearly felt a little melted rubber mark his trail. 

The tinted windows mirrored a shadow of his face back, but even the miniscule reflection of light betrayed the bags underneath his eyes as he opened the passenger door. A billowing blizzard welcomed him into the caramel leather seat, and he half-fell into the chair with three-second "ahhh" before glancing over at the driver.

"Well, Kiki, we did it." Max smiled and waved his phone in her direction. The light caught the crack in the screen and the 5% remaining battery display. "Two whole _crates_ of gloves from Campbell-Strauss. Nice ones, too. Easily two hundred dollars fair market value, and _one hundred percent_ off the books she gave us."

"Mhm." Kiki Mathews, nominally an Executive Assistant Intern for Max's current employer, did not look up from her phone, though Max's arrival grabbed enough of her attention to re-orient the AC blasting his seat back towards her own. "You gonna have time to shave before the meeting? Dad said you looked pretty rough at the last one."

"...no." Max clicked his tongue. "And actually, we need to stop at the drugstore on the other side of town. There's some photo prints we have to pick up before the meeting, but the printer here only has two 4-star reviews."

"Nuh-uh. My instructions are that if you didn't clean up, then I'm not allowed to drive you to the meeting." Something on her screen glittered a neon pink, and Max saw block letters display 'Gold Accuracy' right before he noticed her phone was held in landscape. 

"Gah. Dumb, dumb. Of course that's why I got to ride in the Lexus." He slapped his cheek twice. "Okay, fine. What if we stop at the drugstore, and _then_ I go clean up?"

"Just gold?" Kiki cursed under breath, then exhaled before putting her phone in the console. "I dunno. Sounds like we're gonna be late."

"We're not gonna be late. I promise."

"You promise?" Her tone betrayed some give.

"I promise."

Fifteen minutes after the client meeting began, Edgar Mathews stepped out of the rented conference room, ran his hands through his short salt-and-pepper hair, and looked up and down the hallways until he spotted one Max Fischer, bolting towards the room from the front lobby, manilla folder in hand.

"Oh, Christ." Edgar chuckled, then intercepted his sprinting, breathless first employee at the divide just next to the door and out-of-sight for the client within. "You alright? And what's this? And did you shave?"

"My heart's in my lungs but yes; some very important _printed_ photos for the case because the last client didn't want to look at the 4-inch screen of my phone; and no, but I washed the new beard, and that's fine, right?" The last answer was punctuated with a stifled heave.

"Too scruffy. But we'll talk in a moment, we're past showtime." He patted Max on the back and shot a thumbs-up, then guided him into the room.

"Mr. Cunningham! Great to see you again." Max flashed what ideally should've passed for a welcoming grin and offered his right palm. "Sorry, I'm a little sweaty, but I think we've got a great final report for you today."

"I'll pass, but thank you, son." Jasper Cunningham, Supervisor of the Midwestern Piracy and Intellectual Property Theft division at the FBI, gently brushed Max's hand away and adjusted his hefty weight in the undersized office chair. "I won't lie and say that I don't have some... well, great expectations for your report. Might go without saying, but some the higher-ups were getting antsy about an external audit lasting as long as this one. But I told em, I said you can't make a good brisket faster just by turning up the heat."

"And we certainly appreciate your incredible support when it comes to both administrative advocacy and ground-level access." Edgar subtly flashed his cufflinks as he rubbed his chin. "You seem to know exactly what helps these audits go well."

"Oh, heck, after what you two did for my golf buddy Myers and his uncle over at the SEC office, I knew the Mathews Group was _exactly_ what we needed for this round." Cunningham clapped one oversized hand against another in front of his face. "So, what you boys got for me?"

"A-ha, right down to it." Edgar revealed a leather portfolio from his briefcase, opened to the first laminated spread, typeset in navy, black, and gray, and delicately placed the chart-laden pages in front of the client. "Well, even as auditors, we were very impressed with your division, Jasper. Employees follow labor process down to the detail; each expense had a proper paper trail, with value-to-KPIs never exceeding Bureau threshold; and even your Equipment Custodian seemed ready for next year's acquisition standards."

"Ugh, Gloria." Cunningham sniffled and bounced the page under one sausage finger. "Almost a shame she passed muster. Remember I told you about her emailing _my_ superior over a compliance issue?"

"I do." Max piped up from a seat away. "And that was after you even gave her the first half in writing, if I recall?"

"You do remember." Cunningham nodded slowly. "Could stand to learn a lesson or two, that one."

"Mm... hmm." Edgar paused, then matched the pace of his client's nod. "Insubordination is indeed a terrible problem. I guess we can thank our lucky stars that she didn't fail you an audit."

"Eh." Cunningham rolled his eyes, then focused back. "Well, I'm pleased that there's no major issue. What can you tell me about the rest of this, here?" He flipped through some more of the pages, smudging the black pebbled borders.

"I'm glad you asked!" Edgar beamed, almost unprofessionally. "First off, I'll say that your investigation process is incredibly impressive for its full standards compliance. But, while reading some of the recent legislation, I noticed that there's an unseen opportunity here--with one minor change in your checklist, you could run up to three parallel IPT investigations per unit at the same time, provided they're linked to the same IP! That means a threefold reduction in administrative labor and saving a remarkable twenty-to-thirty percent in per-investigation overhead. Taxpayer savings, of course, but then some fraction of that budget could be funneled into--"

"Sorry, Edgar, just that a quick question that came to my head." Cunningham held up a hand. "Was there anything... er, _fishy_ that you noticed around the equipment duties? I mean, I certainly don't think there's any fraud happening, per se, but, you know, I'd like to know if there's at least something we can improve in that arena."

Edgar looked confused. "Umm..." He looked to left, squinted, and bit his lip. He took out his own copy of the report, just stapled paper, and started scanning each of the pages. "Not that I can see." A brief glint of realization crossed his expression before being suppressed back into a now-feigned puzzlement. "Max, you wouldn't happen to have anything, would you?"

"Pure chance, but I actually do." This was a hard smile to fight. "I think we can all concede that Mrs. Greene has appeared to toe the line for her Equipment Custodian duties for a good, long while. But we did encounter evidence that she might have some extra reason to stay in her current position, beyond merely serving her country."

A light turned on behind Cunningham's beady eyes as he raised a brow. "You don't say. How unforeseen."

Edgar leaned back in his chair, creating a direct line-of-sight between Max and the client, even as he himself crossed and uncrossed his legs. "Such things often come up during the type of exhaustive audits that the Mathews Group performs, you can understand. Sometimes they prove to be a problem. Sometimes not."

"We discovered that Mrs. Greene had accepted a personal gift of reportable value, made towards one of her competing professional interests, and, worst of all, gifted by one of your own contractors, Campbell-Strauss Electric Supply." Max flung a few of his photographs such that they landed, in disarray, right on the table in front of Cunningham. "The gift was not reported, either in your records or her own, since its receipt in the previous fiscal year."

"Heavens." Cunningham vibrated with malicious joy. "Obviously, such behavior cannot be tolerated from a servant of the public. To think that such a thing would happen under my supervision... nothing short of a serious betrayal of trust."

Edgar coughed into his sleeve. "Now, we present these sort of things simply for your awareness. As external auditors, we can't make a verdict about what sort of changes are mandatory; it's well-within both you and your superiors' power to forgive these sort of errors in judgment, should you feel the employee is not at risk for repeat or escalating offense."

"And those sort of discussions will, of course, be held." Cunningham tented his fingers and grinned. "I am thrilled with the attention to detail and commitment to rigor I see in this report. Fine work, gentlemen." He rolled forward, up and out of his chair, and extended a palm to Edgar.

"Ah. Of course." Edgar returned the shake, firm and with a solid clasp. Max stood up behind him.

"I feel obliged to say," Cunningham bounced his hand up and down with excitement, "that I've never felt so well understood by an external auditing firm. Rest assured, I will be recommending the Mathews Group to all my friends in leadership--whether they even require audits or not!" A true belly laugh emerged and reverberated across the glass walls.

Edgar and Max returned their own less-hearty laughs, and Max leaned forward for his own handshake, which was met in earnest. "Thank you, sir. It's been a wonderful opportunity to work with you."

"And likewise. You have a bright future, young man. You and your boss, both." Cunningham nodded, then began to waddle towards the elevator, where he waved one final goodbye with a toothy smile.

Edgar and Max stood at the edge of the conference room in silence. Edgar adjusted his sleeves. Max leaned his back against the wall, pushing his suit up around his neck. 

For a moment they stood, then Edgar went over to where the client had sat, scooped up the now-forgotten leather portfolio, and placed it back in his briefcase. He walked back and placed a hand on Max's shoulder. "Can I treat you to dinner? Got a few process notes we should review."

"There's Tex-Mex two buildings down. Ran past it from the parking lot. If we take the stairs, we can pretend that four flights burns enough calories to get after a nacho platter."

Edgar looked pensive for a moment longer, then broke with a wry grin. "Atta boy."

Ambient mug had finally coalesced in the evening cool and the light plinking of rain against the all-glass front-wall of an ex-warehouse's bottom floor, reverberating out in the cement expanse into a mild, pleasant cacophony outside of the carpet-glued cubicle walls that surrounded Edgar's desk, a rich cherry-dyed mahogany proudly representing one of only three static members of this environment that had ever tasted life.

Max's leg rustled the leaves of one of the other members--a decorative indoor tree--his position shifting awkwardly in the cushioned chair. While he'd never felt particularly comfy in wheel-less office seating, something about the current state of his body couldn't seem to settle such that he could eat the smothered enchilada he'd somehow had a whim to try. 

Edgar sat his opposite on the other side of that ornate desk, leaning his head back at a slight angle, sanitized hands clasped over his stomach and an empty to-go container sitting cradled on a fabric oven pad. "...and, you won't believe this, that _same_ guy is now the pastor for our parish."

"Just insanity." Max laughed and poked at the enchilada once more, not even quite sure what the contents were supposed to be. "Nobody ever told them where he was for those three years?"

"Of course not." Edgar shrugged, and slid off the Rolex watch that left an indent on his wrist. "And who knows, maybe he really did change. It happens."

Max scoffed and took a long sip from the drink that had been resting on the side of the chair's legs, precariously balanced as to not spill on the rug below. "It could. But I can't imagine giving _that_ up to become a pastor, of all things."

Edgar swiveled in his chair, rubbed his temples for a second, then raised an eyebrow at Max with his hand on his chin. "You don't think people can change, Max? That they can't redeem themselves?"

Pausing, Max set down his drink to raise one hand. "I wouldn't say _can't_. Functionally, they don't, though. People are creatures of momentum. It's a part of every media story. Like: famous person gets caught doing X. Everybody makes noise at them for doing X, and if there's enough noise, they always say something along the lines of 'oh I knew it was maybe sorta wrong, but I never had the courage to stop my own behavior, until', you know, 'everybody made all that noise'. There's no, like, self-motivated moment in the middle of their bad behavior. It always takes an external signal. Not a good sign for redemption."

"So what about my new pastor? What was his external signal?"

"Oh, crashing the semi, for sure."

"But, he was by himself."

"Being by yourself doesn't mean you still don't have the superego, by which I mean, the notion of 'other people'. Plus, he would either have to lie about where the semi came from, and why it was full of all those counterfeit lion pelts, or he could just give in, 'take it as a sign', and call it a good run. My guess? He ran out of creative solutions."

"Hmm." Edgar tapped his desk, reached below it, and produced that signature half-empty bottle of Elijah Craig, its caramel glow illuminating the stark-white paper below, along with two crystal glasses. "And, don't take this the wrong way, because you know as well as I do that I'm glad to be out from Cunningham's contract, but, keeping the same analysis... what was the deal with Gloria Greene?"

"What do you mean?" Max took a long, last sip of the slightly-metallic Tex-Mex soda water to cleanse the pallette. He felt the rumblings of a Pavlovian response to that particular bottle, but couldn't identify what.

"What was her continuing evil? What couldn't she have stopped until we brought it up with her boss?" Edgar was speaking slower, in an inflection reminiscient of a high school English teacher.

"I, uhh..." Max folded his arms and leaned back. "Well, it's hard to say. She clearly wasn't very happy under his supervision, and it seems like she expressed herself via petty behavior. Did her boss deserve it? Probably, given what we know now from working with him. But if anything, there's no way that sort of long-term negativity doesn't build up and affect all areas of your life. Which makes today's events a necessary external signal." The back of the chair has a little too much give.

"Oh, I meant the fraud. You know, the thing that you caught?" Edgar's hand sat gripped on the wooden top of the whiskey bottle, his thumb a half-inch away from a proper grip.

"Ah, _that_." Max settled down in his chair, then slapped his hands down on the armrests, feeling the curves of the wood. "Honestly, it probably wasn't even her fault."

Edgar's grip corrected and he twisted the top of the bottle by just a few degrees. Suddenly, the warm light of the lamp above them seemed just a touch more fluorescent and cold. "Go on."

"She had a neighbor, some nice old guy named Gary Forstein, that was a bigshot at Campbell-Strauss before he retired. Gary happened to have a few boxes of gloves from the early days of the company, so when she went around asking for extra gardening supplies for the community plot, he apparently said he was too old to find any better use, and handed them off to her."

Edgar popped the wooden cork. "You mentioned that she knowingly accepted the gift from a contractor. Yet you say he's retired?"

"She thought so. He thought so. But no." Max massaged his own fingers, sore from flipping through the pages at the garden, and crossed his legs. "He's still on the payroll as a Product Consultant, though the old dingbat doesn't know that showing up twice a month to greenlight product specsheets makes him a full-on W-2 employee on Campbell-Strauss's books. They're taking good care of him. Though you can see what that means for _her_."

"I see." Edgar squinted at Max, slowly nodding, up and down. "I see..."

A minute or so passed. Max felt fidgety just looking at the opened Elijah Craig, the spice wafting up through his nose into his brain. "Sorry, are we drinking? Normally I wouldn't presume, but that does smell _really_ nice, and it's been a long day."

Biting his cheek, Edgar finally stopped nodding, picked up the bottle by the base, and delicately poured the liquor into the glasses without a single splashed drop. "...I'm worried about you, Max."

<!-- 17 JUL 2024: 1039 -->

The pause was long enough that Max was probably supposed to infer something that he didn't. His hands began to shake. "How do you mean? The client's happy. We got paid for auditing. What's not to celebrate?"

<!-- what does logan-in-the-chair want to write, right now? -->

Edgar sighed, then reached out a glass to Max's minutely-vibrating hand, and took his own glass in his left before sitting back down and swirling it while leaning back. "At 30 years old, Arthur Andersen, who had founded his own accounting firm, had just finished the books for one of his most major clients--maritime freight, nearly as big way back in 1915--when he found out that _mere days_ after the fiscal year ended, one of his client's largest boats had sunk to the bottom of the ocean. And as he sat there, financial report in hand, ready to deliver to the publisher, Arthur had a _choice_." He took one tiny sip and clicked his tongue.

Already, about half of Max's glass had been covertly drained down his throat during the story, and he attempted a shrug that pushed his collarbone up to the mounting frog in his throat. "Material event or not, the year ended, right? He's done due diligence."

Edgar nodded. "So his client said, too. No regulatory guidance back then, either. He stood to take no losses, not even to his reputation... had no reason to rock the boat and threaten a profitable relationship with his long-term client."

"Okay, okay," Max eked a nervous chuckle, "I know where this is going. Isn't Andersen the firm that stamped Enron's shady accounting? And this is the first time we should've known him and his company had no integrity?"

"No." Smiling and shaking his head, Edgar took another baby sip, closing his eyes. Thunder cracked outside, just far enough away that it soon melted into the hum of the portable air conditioner. "Famously, he asked his client if they thought current and potential investors would want to know about such a material event sooner rather than later. They were furious with him, threatened to drop his little accounting company and leave it to wither and die. But, he re-opened the books, logged the material event, and pushed through everyone who fought him along the way."

"...only to roll in his grave 86 years later..." Max grumbled.

"The point I'm trying to make, Max, is that external audit has a higher calling. We don't just serve clients and ourselves. We serve the _people_, even before the other two."

Max's knuckles whitened against the glass, hopefully imperceptibly. "I'm sorry, but Boss... the _people_ don't pay for our services. I'm fine with the higher calling stuff, I am. And I'll try to do better. But can you blame me for trying to serve, y'know, our customers? The firm itself?"

"...I can't." Edgar set down the glass and pressed his hands together, looking about the room before settling back on eye contact with Max. "You're too good at your job."

Max leaned forward and cocked his head, trying to wear the positive reinforcement. "Thank you, sir."

"Don't take it as a compliment." Edgar raised a single finger, a  faint glimmer of contempt in his tone. "You're smart, and worse, you know it. You used that to figure out which parts of the job seem to matter matter, and which don't, then discarded the parts you felt didn't matter."

"Look, I'm just trying to be efficient. Provide value, you know?"

"I know." He drained his own glass, then moved to pour another. "I know."

With a frank huff, Max cracked his knuckles, trying to relieve some of the tension in his grip, but stood up involuntarily. "Am I in trouble? Were you thinking of firing me? Because I can try to do better! I'll keep you in the loop. You can tell me whether or not something 'serves the people' adequately enough. We can fix it, I swear."

"Whoa, whoa." Edgar gestured by flattening his palm and waving it down. "Nothing so crazy. I'm not gonna fire you over this, especially if it's just our first time talking about it. You're a fantastic investigator and you work hard. Plus, God, what would I possibly tell Tiffany? 'Sorry I fired your fiance for trying too hard to make us money'? She'd knock my head off with an iron right there on Hole 03. Lovely woman."

"Oh, thank goodness." Max's eyes darted to the left as he tried to remember some details about who knew what.

"But I also don't think you're right that you can fix it--on your own _or_ with my supervision. Think objectively, and you'll see it's just the circumstance: there's no incentive to do anything other than grit your teeth and toe the line." Edgar flipped his phone out from his jacket pocket, checked an email notification that had just popped up on the front screen, and slipped in back in. "So we're gonna change things up, a little."

Waving a hand, Max finally released the tension in his shoulders. "Hey, as long as you keep letting me do my own thing, here, I'll happily keep a feelings journal and volunteer on community project. This is the best job I've ever had."

"Well, that's the thing..." Edgar grinned. "We're hiring you a partner. Someone to shadow you, learn all the things that you know about what we do. Someone with, well, hopefully a little more of a conscience."

"Er, okay, but I would _really_ advise _not_ doing that." Max grit his teeth and the pace of his breathing increased. "See, not only do I prefer the independence, but so much of the job is running around, and thinking quickly and quietly, and enough of the job is intuitive and working in your own style, so it's hard to teach, and having to explain myself to someone, especially someone lacking context, would really only slow me down, so we should really only proceed with that solution if you're dead-set on us losing probably like 50-70% velocity for our cases, and something like a feelings journal would really be more of the Pareto--"

"She just signed the offer, two minutes ago." Edgar stood up and  pushed in his chair. "Her name's Jerika, and she's starting tomorrow. Her morning will be with me, where we'll get everything sorted, but I want her afternoon to be with you. Probably on the Mauve client. I'll have Kiki get her clearance sorted so you can go on-site if the need arises."

"Boss, I think this is a really bad idea." His forehead was sweating. "We've got a good thing going right, bar some of what you mentioned... and there are so many things here that will suffer for this. We're not ready to take on somebody new. _I'm_ not ready."

A well-loved leather briefcase was hoisted up from below the desk onto its surface, and Edgar wrapped his fingers around the handle. "Max... this is an opportunity. I know it's been fun and chaotic with just the two of us working cases, but it's time for the Mathews Group, as a whole, to mature. This is how we'll get there."

"It's really too late, isn't it? You're not changing your mind?" 

"I could. But I won't. We have to do not just the hard thing, but the right thing." Edgar loosed the raincoat from the rack on the wall, and sauntered over towards the door. 

Max followed. "Well... no hard feelings, right? Still trust me to lock up and get the lights before I go?"

"Of course." Edgar patted Max on the back with a gloved hand. "Tell Tiffany I said hello. I guess I'll just pray that she doesn't think I'm being too hard on you. Maybe she can help you feel better about it, too... love has a funny way of stabilizing in crazy times." His expression eased into a faraway gaze before snapping back. "Have a good night, Max. Get home safe."

"Will do, Boss. You too." 

The closing of the swinging push door rang a multipart metallic echo on the surrounding concrete, never truly decaying into silence even as minutes past and Max stood there, his skull overheating as the rest of his body shivered in the wet chill of the DMV-area night. 

Perhaps an hour passed before Max stopped pacing around the ex-warehouse, the wearing divot in his leather soles observably deeper, and flopped into the mildly-stained secondhand fabric office chair that had been tucked under his aluminum desk a few yards in front of Edgar's office. That mildewy scent that always seemed to hang in the air specifically at his desk had become suspiciously strong.

A locked cabinet drawer, the biggest in its stack at the bottom, screeched open in Max's shaky grip, to reveal a flannel-patterned sleeping bag fraying at the seams, which effortlessly unrolled to the flat position right behind his desk, into a rectangle on the floor where, until covered, a particularly careful observer could note never gathered dust and debris quite  like the rest of Max's desk-area.

He lied there, in the bag. His eyes hurt to close. His phone buzzed and he snatched it up off the floor beside him with the ferocity of a starving rat.

`Tiff: hey you awake? sorry it's been a few months`

Heart skipped a beat.

`Max: yeah, no worries. just got off work`

`Tiff: good day? feels like you enjoy the long ones`

`Max: went ok`

`Max: he's still trying to turn us into management consultants`

`Tiff: sounds about right for him`

`Tiff: can you call me? would prefer to talk`

Still in the Favorites tab.

"...hey."

"_Hey! You sure sound tired!_"

"A little. But probably not out anytime soon. I work better sleep-deprived, anyway. More efficient." Max felt the wry in his voice, as if the tone would make this less weird.

"_Yeah? What happened?_"

"I'm getting a partner, apparently. Someone to follow me around and make sure that I'm not being too evil, and all."

"_...that sounds like it'll be really good for you, actually._"

"Maybe."

Silence hung.

"_Hey, so... I didn't want to tell you this until I was really sure. But I think it's important to say it._"

"It's fine. I'm sorry I wasn't careful with that first job, too... and I know I broke a lot of promises, implicit and explicit, with you. You don't have to say anything. You deserve better than apologizing to someone like me."

"_Oh. Um, thanks, that does mean a lot. But that's not exactly what I meant..._"

"Shoot." Max cursed silently under his breath a few more times.

"_The deal is... well, I'm late. More than late. It's been three months. I guess I was hoping it wouldn't be anything, or like a health issue, since we're, well, you know, but... I made an appointment, and it's... it's what it looks like. Do you... do you get what I'm saying?"

"I--" Max squeezed the edge of the sleeping bag, twisting it around his fingers. "I do. Get what you're saying, that is."

"_...do you have anything you want to say?_"

His hand moved to massage his temples, slowly but deeply, and pinch the bridge between his eyes and nose. "I just... I can't process anything like that, right now. I'm sorry. But I can't say anything useful, because I can't think about this, right now. Sorry. Really. I'll talk to you later."

He could hear little sobs start to crackle from the phone speaker. "_It's okay, I get that it's scary, but if you could just tell me that you're willing to be there and that it'll be al--_"

Max hung up the phone. He rolled onto his back, and stared straight up. Bare metal rods dangled a sparse array of lights and safety sensors, the only structure marring his view of the ceiling's black abyss.
