"Look, I know _you_ think saying that 'you have nothing to hide' is both correct and disarming. Everybody who says that is betting on the fantasy that people like me will be so dumbfounded by your openness and honestly that we'll magically take our jobs less seriously. And I'll tell you, what sucks is that saying you had 'nothing to hide' probably was once an unprecedented display of virtue! Allowing the world to examine your trail and find that there was nothing but clarity and goodness all along... I'm certain in an earlier age, more of us would listen to that signal."

"Well, it's still true in my case."

The two stood in what might've once been a garage, until the door had been ripped off and the outer walls suffered a plastering of pixel-visible stock photos depicting agriculture idyllica in a vision of what a non-DMV resident might've supposed DMV-area farms looked like--and such a vision would be choked out in the unbearable mug the moment one stepped out of any vehicle that bothered to stop in the DMV. 

Children were laughing outside, their hands running through the leaves of the unfruited plants that lazily flopped up through the soil and wire held together by reclaimed palette wood. A cicada flew in from the outside, made a clumsy u-turn around in the shade of the interior, and flew right back out.

Max grit his teeth as he thumbed through even more yellowed paper stuffed haphazardly in the dismounted kitchen cabinets. He'd be getting paper cuts in his haste if the pages weren't already so thin and falling apart. "Okay, but you understand that if you _were_ hiding something, that'd still be one of the more optimal things to say to me, right? Since it'd be weirder to either be silent or be overly inquisitive about what I'm looking at. You saying that to me means nothing, and in fact it means less than nothing. It means you think so little of me that saying _that_ would influence my behavior."

Gloria Greene, Senior Equipment Custodian of the Midwestern Piracy And Intellectual Property Theft division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and dressed in dirt-covered overalls and braids unbecoming of a woman of her career status, let out an exasperated sigh and shrugged her shoulders. "I'll admit I'm more used to auditors asking me questions _before_ doling out the morality sermons and pearl-clutching over offenses I've caused."

Max Fischer, former Junior Accountant at the FBI (for a whole eight months), yanked open a rigid wooden drawer, spraining his knuckles and embedding blisters into his fingerprints. He didn't feel the sting until a few seconds later, then grimaced through the pain. "Then you might want to double-check their incentives. Feigning timidity while gathering evidence is a solid strategy when I think I might still need to ask for money or favors."

Birds were chirping. A deliberate hand rang the bell twice outside the garage, and a hushed voice whispered to a child that the cashier would be on her way.

Gloria smiled. "And you're sure that you won't care about what I, being one of the people that will report on your performance as a contractor, will say about your brazenly marching up to a non-profit that I volunteer labor for _strictly_ off-the-clock and demanding access to our records when I could be helping the hungry folks outside? You don't care about currying my favor, when I've already done so much and could probably just kick you out right now?"

"No. I do not." Tilting his head, Max kicked around a few cardboard boxes and listened to the shaking contents. "And you can wait for our investigation to finish, or you can give me thirty more seconds of talking. Either way, you'll learn why."

Max spotted the jet-black Lexus parked haphazardly on the street, and when he closed his eyes, he could just make out the soft purr of its German engine. The asphalt baked the bottom of his shoes, and with each step he nearly felt a little melted rubber mark his trail. 

The tinted windows mirrored a shadow of his face back, but even the miniscule reflection of light betrayed the bags underneath his eyes as he opened the passenger door. A billowing blizzard welcomed him into the caramel leather seat, and he half-fell into the chair with three-second "ahhh" before glancing over at the driver.

"Well, Kiki, we did it." Max smiled and waved his phone in her direction. The light caught the crack in the screen and the 5% remaining battery display. "Two whole _crates_ of gloves from Campbell-Strauss. Nice ones, too. Easily two hundred dollars fair market value, and _one hundred percent_ off the books she gave us."

"Mhm." Kiki Mathews, nominally an Executive Assistant Intern for Max's current employer, did not look up from her phone, though Max's arrival grabbed enough of her attention to re-orient the AC blasting his seat back towards her own. "You gonna have time to shave before the meeting? Dad said you looked pretty rough at the last one."

"...no." Max clicked his tongue. "And actually, we need to stop at the drugstore on the other side of town. There's some photo prints we have to pick up before the meeting, but the printer here only has two 4-star reviews."

"Nuh-uh. My instructions are that if you didn't clean up, then I'm not allowed to drive you to the meeting." Something on her screen glittered a neon pink, and Max saw block letters display 'Gold Accuracy' right before he noticed her phone was held in landscape. 

"Gah. Dumb, dumb. Of course that's why I got to ride in the Lexus." He slapped his cheek twice. "Okay, fine. What if we stop at the drugstore, and _then_ I go clean up?"

"Just gold?" Kiki cursed under breath, then exhaled before putting her phone in the console. "I dunno. Sounds like we're gonna be late."

"We're not gonna be late. I promise."

"You promise?" Her tone betrayed some give.

"I promise."

Fifteen minutes after the client meeting began, Edgar Mathews stepped out of the rented conference room, ran his hands through his short salt-and-pepper hair, and looked up and down the hallways until he spotted one Max Fischer, bolting towards the room from the front lobby, manilla folder in hand.

"Oh, Christ." Edgar chuckled, then intercepted his sprinting, breathless first employee at the divide just next to the door and out-of-sight for the client within. "You alright? And what's this? And did you shave?"

"My heart's in my lungs but yes; some very important _printed_ photos for the case because the last client didn't want to look at the 4-inch screen of my phone; and no, but I washed the new beard, and that's fine, right?" The last answer was punctuated with a stifled heave.

"Too scruffy. But we'll talk in a moment, we're past showtime." He patted Max on the back and shot a thumbs-up, then guided him into the room.

"Mr. Cunningham! Great to see you again." Max flashed what ideally should've passed for a welcoming grin and offered his right palm. "Sorry, I'm a little sweaty, but I think we've got a great final report for you today."

"I'll pass, but thank you, son." Jasper Cunningham, Supervisor of the Midwestern Piracy and Intellectual Property Theft division at the FBI, gently brushed Max's hand away and adjusted his hefty weight in the undersized office chair. "I won't lie and say that I don't have some... well, great expectations for your report. Might go without saying, but some the higher-ups were getting antsy about an external audit lasting as long as this one. But I told em, I said you can't make a good brisket faster just by turning up the heat."

"And we certainly appreciate your incredible support when it comes to both administrative advocacy and ground-level access." Edgar subtly flashed his cufflinks as he rubbed his chin. "You seem to know exactly what helps these audits go well."

"Oh, heck, after what you two did for my golf buddy Myers and his uncle over at the SEC office, I knew the Mathews Group was _exactly_ what we needed for this round." Cunningham clapped one oversized hand against another in front of his face. "So, what you boys got for me?"

"A-ha, right down to it." Edgar revealed a leather portfolio from his briefcase, opened to the first laminated spread, typeset in navy, black, and gray, and delicately placed the chart-laden pages in front of the client. "Well, even as auditors, we were very impressed with your division, Jasper. Employees follow labor process down to the detail; each expense had a proper paper trail, with value-to-KPIs never exceeding Bureau threshold; and even your Equipment Custodian seemed ready for next year's acquisition standards."

"Ugh, Gloria." Cunningham sniffled and bounced the page under one sausage finger. "Almost a shame she passed muster. Remember I told you about her emailing _my_ superior over a compliance issue?"

"I do." Max piped up from a seat away. "And that was after you even gave her the first half in writing, if I recall?"

"You do remember." Cunningham nodded slowly. "Could stand to learn a lesson or two, that one."

"Mm... hmm." Edgar paused, then matched the pace of his client's nod. "Insubordination is indeed a terrible problem. I guess we can thank our lucky stars that she didn't fail you an audit."

"Eh." Cunningham rolled his eyes, then focused back. "Well, I'm pleased that there's no major issue. What can you tell me about the rest of this, here?" He flipped through some more of the pages, smudging the black pebbled borders.

"I'm glad you asked!" Edgar beamed, almost unprofessionally. "First off, I'll say that your investigation process is incredibly impressive for its full standards compliance. But, while reading some of the recent legislation, I noticed that there's an unseen opportunity here--with one minor change in your checklist, you could run up to three parallel IPT investigations per unit at the same time, provided they're linked to the same IP! That means a threefold reduction in administrative labor and saving a remarkable twenty-to-thirty percent in per-investigation overhead. Taxpayer savings, of course, but then some fraction of that budget could be funneled into--"

"Sorry, Edgar, just that a quick question that came to my head." Cunningham held up a hand. "Was there anything... er, _fishy_ that you noticed around the equipment duties? I mean, I certainly don't think there's any fraud happening, per se, but, you know, I'd like to know if there's at least something we can improve in that arena."

Edgar looked confused. "Umm..." He looked to left, squinted, and bit his lip. He took out his own copy of the report, just stapled paper, and started scanning each of the pages. "Not that I can see." A brief glint of realization crossed his expression before being suppressed back into a now-feigned puzzlement. "Max, you wouldn't happen to have anything, would you?"

"Pure chance, but I actually do." This was a hard smile to fight. "I think we can all concede that Mrs. Greene has appeared to toe the line for her Equipment Custodian duties for a good, long while. But we did encounter evidence that she might have some extra reason to stay in her current position, beyond merely serving her country."

A light turned on behind Cunningham's beady eyes as he raised a brow. "You don't say. How unforeseen."

Edgar leaned back in his chair, creating a direct line-of-sight between Max and the client, even as he himself crossed and uncrossed his legs. "Such things often come up during the type of exhaustive audits that the Mathews Group performs, you can understand. Sometimes they prove to be a problem. Sometimes not."

"The truth is that we found evidence that Mrs. Greene had accepted a personal gift of reportable value, made towards one of her competing professional interests, and, worst of all, gifted by one of your own contractors, Campbell-Strauss Electric Supply." Max flung a few of his photographs such that they landed, in disarray, right on the table in front of Cunningham. "The gift was not reported, either in your records or her own, since its receipt in the previous fiscal year."

"Heavens." Cunningham vibrated with malicious joy. "Obviously, such behavior cannot be tolerated from a servant of the public. To think that such a thing would happen under my supervision... nothing short of a serious betrayal of trust."

Edgar coughed into his sleeve. "Now, we present these sort of things simply for your awareness. As external auditors, we can't make a verdict about what sort of changes are mandatory; it's well-within both you and your superiors' power to forgive these sort of errors in judgment, should you feel the employee is not at risk for repeat or escalating offense."

"And those sort of discussions will, of course, be held." Cunningham tented his fingers and grinned. "I am thrilled with the attention to detail and commitment to rigor I see in this report. Fine work, gentlemen." He rolled forward, up and out of his chair, and extended a palm to Edgar.

"Ah. Of course." Edgar returned the shake, firm and with a solid clasp. Max stood up behind him.

"I feel obliged to say," Cunningham bounced his hand up and down with excitement, "that I've never felt so well understood by an external auditing firm. Rest assured, I will be recommending the Mathews Group to all my friends in leadership--whether they even require audits or not!" A true belly laugh emerged and reverberated across the glass walls.

Edgar and Max returned their own less-hearty laughs, and Max leaned forward for his own handshake, which was met in earnest. "Thank you, sir. It's been a wonderful opportunity to work with you."

"And likewise. You have a bright future, young man. You and your boss, both." Cunningham nodded, then began to waddle towards the elevator, where he waved one final goodbye with a toothy smile.

Edgar and Max stood at the edge of the conference room in silence. Edgar adjusted his sleeves. Max leaned his back against the wall, pushing his suit up around his neck. 

For a moment they stood, then Edgar went over to where the client had sat, scooped up the now-forgotten leather portfolio, and placed it back in his briefcase. He walked back and placed a hand on Max's shoulder. "Can I treat you to dinner? Got a few process notes we should review."

"There's Tex-Mex two buildings down. Ran past it from the parking lot. If we take the stairs, we can pretend that four flights burns enough calories to get after a nacho platter."

Edgar looked pensive for a moment longer, then broke with a wry grin. "Atta boy."
