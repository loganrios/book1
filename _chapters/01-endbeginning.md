"Look, I know _you_ think saying that 'you have nothing to hide' is both correct and disarming. Everybody who says that is betting on the fantasy that people like me will be so dumbfounded by your openness and honestly that we'll magically take our jobs less seriously. And I'll tell you, what sucks is that saying you had 'nothing to hide' probably was once an unprecedented display of virtue! Allowing the world to examine your trail and find that there was nothing but clarity and goodness all along... I'm certain in an earlier age, more of us would listen to that signal."

"Well, it's still true in my case."

The two stood in what might've once been a garage, until the door had been ripped off and the outer walls suffered a plastering of pixel-visible stock photos depicting agriculture idyllica in a vision of what a non-DMV resident might've supposed DMV-area farms looked like--and such a vision would be choked out in the unbearable mug the moment one stepped out of any vehicle that bothered to stop in the DMV. 

Children were laughing outside, their hands running through the leaves of the unfruited plants that lazily flopped up through the soil and wire held together by reclaimed palette wood. A cicada flew in from the outside, made a clumsy u-turn around in the shade of the interior, and flew right back out.

Max grit his teeth as he thumbed through even more yellowed paper stuffed haphazardly in the dismounted kitchen cabinets. He'd be getting paper cuts in his haste if the pages weren't already so thin and falling apart. "Okay, but you understand that if you _were_ hiding something, that'd still be one of the more optimal things to say to me, right? Since it'd be weirder to either be silent or be overly inquisitive about what I'm looking at. You saying that to me means nothing, and in fact it means less than nothing. It means you think so little of me that saying _that_ would influence my behavior."

Gloria Greene, Senior Equipment Custodian of the Midwestern Piracy And Intellectual Property Theft division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and dressed in dirt-covered overalls and braids unbecoming of a woman of her career status, let out an exasperated sigh and shrugged her shoulders. "I'll admit I'm more used to auditors asking me questions _before_ doling out the morality sermons and pearl-clutching over offenses I've caused."

Max Fischer, former Junior Accountant at the FBI (for a whole eight months), yanked open a rigid wooden drawer, spraining his knuckles and embedding blisters into his fingerprints. He didn't feel the sting until a few seconds later, then grimaced through the pain. "Then you might want to double-check their incentives. Feigning timidity while gathering evidence is a solid strategy when I think I might still need to ask for money or favors."

Birds were chirping. A deliberate hand rang the bell twice outside the garage, and a hushed voice whispered to a child that the cashier would be on her way.

Gloria smiled. "And you're sure that you won't care about what I, being one of the people that will report on your performance as a contractor, will say about your brazenly marching up to a non-profit that I volunteer labor for _strictly_ off-the-clock and demanding access to our records when I could be helping the hungry folks outside? You don't care about currying my favor, when I've already done so much and could probably just kick you out right now?"

"No. I am not." Tilting his head, Max kicked around a few cardboard boxes and listened to the shaking contents. "And you can wait for our investigation to finish, or you can give me thirty more seconds of talking. Either way, you'll learn why."
