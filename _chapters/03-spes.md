Of all stimulus to be expected when peering through the bottom crack of a door, behind which an illicit conversation was taking place, nudging your phone's microphone by millimeters to see if you can make the waveform bounce a few pixels higher, one would consider a spitball delivered perfectly behind the ear to rank pretty low on the list, being fairly unlikely. But Jerika Jensen had already been having a fairly unlikely sort of day.

She hurriedly covered her own mouth to stop an instinctual gasp from escaping, noticed how her hands reeked of old, flattened carpet, before casting her gaze back towards the direction of the attack.

"Max?" She mouthed. No silhouette appeared in the dim fluorescent hallway, but a legal-paper aeroplane, haphazardly creased yet gliding in abject serenity towards her other palm completed its arc and settled with a soft rustle right in front of her. The handwriting was almost too nice for the rush in which it had been composed.

<note>

You are dumb, and this is a bad idea. 

Read the previous sentence again. 

Again. 

Again. 

Okay. 

But, if you want my help doing this very bad idea, then crawl back down the hallway and slip into the conference room behind the NORTH DOOR (code 1234 (yes, that's really it)). If you go in the SOUTH DOOR, that opens up to the warehouse, and you will die. Go to the NORTH DOOR.

</note>

Any tension she had felt cowered in the presence of the massive *groan* her brain made upon learning that Max wrote exactly as he talked. Nevertheless, she complied with the instructions to the letter, other than reading that first sentence for the third time.

But, when she finally felt the presence of a non-hostile as she slipped through the crack of the conference room door, a chink showed in the armor, and the tickling of a smile pulled at her cheeks. "Wow, I'm so glad you--"

"Don't get the wrong idea," he huffed. She could smell the sweat through the detergent on his clothes. "That cop's still on the road and you're my ride back."

"Right right. Understood." She stopped stopping herself from grinning. "You know, you can just wait here, if you want. I've got things pretty well under-control. Just run over if I yell or text or anything."

Max frowned and pressed his palm against his head. "And what, exactly, are you trying? Voice memos on Android? Please." He yanked her phone out of her hand, mysteriously entered the correct PIN on the first try, scrubbed back a few minutes on the timeline, and pressed play.

"Heh ee woh--ih nev-feffer? Iss geh sick, seven ay-o tuwa mmf... nono, *ay* tuwa mmf ng. Sore? Sore--"

Jerika used two hands to wrestle her phone back from him, no easy feat given the clamminess of his fingers. The last pull nearly sent her tumbling over the cheaply-stitched rolling chair behind her, and it wobbled suspiciously for three whole seconds. "That's fine. My phone has an auto-transcript app for this stuff."

"Okay." He nodded. "Do the auto-transcription. Let's see."

```
There she goes. It's never pepper. 

If you're getting sick, seven days of tuna melt. 

No, eight days of tuna melt. 

More? Torn.
```

"And lo, the fruits of the AI revolution." Max nodded sagely.

"This used to work perfectly back on campus..." Jerika bit her cheek. "Well, it sounds close enough to me. Don't mafia people have a lingo that they use, anyway? This could just be that. Still incriminating."

He sighed. "Look, JJ, what are we here for? If you wanted, we could go file a police report, right now, that there was a gunshot in the building. Tell them you suspect mafia connections if you really want to get questioned for an afternoon. Either way, same result; these guys get off scot-free. I've seen it a million times, it's not worth fighting."

She paused. "You've... seen *this*? One *million* times?"

"Well, some hyperbole, but off by less orders of magnitude than you'd--"

"And you just *do nothing*?"

"Also for some value of 'this', I'd clarify. Italian mafia only about one-eighth of the time, depending on the region."

"Oh, no." Jerika flopped backwards into the chair. The wobbly wheel snapped off and left her torso tilted rightwards by about 10 degrees. She didn't seem to notice. "Wait. But that means we *could* do something. We're the ones who actually *see* it happen."

"Whoa, hey. I signed up to do enough to get you out of here. The feds have their jobs. I have mine."

Her ears had perked forward when he said the word 'feds'. She drew a deep breath, then opened her eyes. "Fine. This situation. What did you have in mind?"

"Thought you'd never ask." Quicker, than she could blink, he produced a laptop and opened it to the first slide of a presentation entitled 'how to not get both of us killed', plain black text on a white background, upon which he lingered for ten seconds longer than situationally advisable. "First, you realize that we're not in a Bond movie."

"This is dumber than my plan."

"Shush. I'm concentrating." His fingers did a sort of cirque-du-soleil over the keyboard, contorting and trapezing in manners inhuman. Application windows popped up, changed display a few times, and before the second half of each window rendered, they were terminated both unceremoniously and yet with extreme prejudice. The F4 key, in particular, twittered like the wing of a hummingbird after the hammering of Alt.

"You must be good at rhythm games." Jerika mused in between checking the crevices between the metal racks for spiders.

Max scoffed. "Former world record holder for the Night of Nights custom map in Guitar Hero World Tour on Wii. My little brother says I peaked at 17."

"Does Kiki know? She must be jealous. Except you'd out yourself as being into Touhou."

"Haven't told her. Not worth it." He smirked, the pace of the taps growing even more frantic, in that way that sacrifices control for showing off. But, to his credit, he was now mixing in mouse clicks. "And wait, how do you know about Touhou? You're a *girl*."

"I know things." There was a lilt to her tone.

"Well, speaking of bullet hells, looks like this isn't their first meeting in this facility." Max finally paused, wiping his hands on the back of his calves. "Logs on the garage say there were three out-of-schedule accesses from his card in the past month. Allegedly, they were approved by his super, but..." He popped open another incomprehensible table of data onto the screen. "No such email or call trail exists from his super's account."

"...what does that mean?" Jerika squinted at the screen. "I mean, I know it means he's faked having permission, but I don't know what that means for us. Do we just show this to management and he gets fired?"

"Ha! No. At best, some suspicious logs result in a suspension, at normal a chat with security personnel, and at worst it makes us look arbitrary." Max rubbed his eyes, then hit the side of his palm down on a table laden with chip dust. A nearby empty bag of Fritos, at least two weeks old judging by the stale aroma, floated to the ground. "What we're looking for is evidence satisfying *all three points* of the fraud triangle. We currently have maybe *half* of one."

Jerika sat down in the chair, rested her elbow on the armrest, placed her head on her palm, and looked up and down at Max.

"What?"

"Just waiting."

"For what?"

"You know, that thing you do. You say some phrase I obviously don't know, then wait to see if I ask what that phrase means, and if I do, you cut me off before I finish asking and explain what that phrase means."

"I mean, you don't have to ask if you don't want to know."

"Obviously I *want* to know. I just don't want to be cut off. It's kinda grating."

"...sorry. I can let you finish."

"...I'm sorry, too. I should let you do your mentoring thing."

"Well, now I'm worried there's nothing I can teach you." Max cracked his knuckles and leaned back in his chair, shaking his head. "After all, you already know about *Touhou*."

"I went as Flandre Scarlet to my church Halloween party. No clue what I was thinking."

"You serious? That true?"

"Yeah."

"Wow. Well, for your future reference, I wouldn't advise telling that story to any coworker, ever. Probably not even new friends, if you can help it."

"Sure, but you outed yourself first. But, before we lose our chance... fraud triangle?"

"Right." Max walked his rolling chair back to a whiteboard.

"Oh, it's a right triangle?" Jerika tilted her head, trying to make out the scrawl as Max reached and strained to not get up out of his chair.

"Just... sure. Yes. It's a right triangle because it shows how people vector away from doing the right thing, and what ties it all together."

"So what's the meaning of 'Motivation' being in the right angle corner?"

"Left as an exercise to the reader." Max cleared his throat.

<!-- NEW -->

Premptively, Jerika leaned forward and waved her hand. "Okay, easy answers: 'motivation'. You don't have to explain this one to me. He doesn't have morals, and he wants money, *boom*, motivated. He deserves the money, because he's doing the bad thing other people won't do; *boom*, rationalization. And because he doesn't have morals, he's willing to do the bad sort of things that others won't; *boom*, opportunity."

"Okay, I know you think you're joking, but I'm worried you don't know how you know that you're joking." 

"I figured you were gonna 'gotcha' me on paper trails." 

He sighed. "It's more than that. 'Motivation' is... well, not that superficial. Think about, I dunno, your taxes. If you were a perfectly rational agent, you'd do your taxes as early as possible, right? There's no extra money to be made or lost by doing them later, if you're a 1040-EZ baby like everybody else under 30. Yet, most people do their taxes whole *months* late. Why?"

"Totally beats me." Jerika flipped out her phone, pressed a single folder on her home screen, and popped open that annual red checkmark logo. "See? $300 return, filed January 2nd. And yes, not totally perfect, but I took New Year's off."

"See, a *party*? That's economically irrational."

"Actually to plan my resolutions. They're like a whole deal in my family. We'd print out a bunch of pictures and paste 'em on a posterboard in the living room."

"Even more ceremony around *not* going to the gym after three days."

"Do *you* go to the gym?"

"No. But I don't make posterboards about going to the gym on holiday weekends."

"Would you consider yourself more likely to go to the gym if you did make posterboards about going to the gym on holiday weekends?"

"Which dovetails back to *motivation*." Max pulled at his collar, noticing the growing heat of irritation in the back of his head. "What sort of people actually do go to the gym? And not just in January."

"Hmm." Her foot swung and brushed the wheels of another office chair, which wobbled concerningly. "Oh, yeah. Those high-schoolers in the ratty string-tanks that curl every dumbbell on the rack for a whole hour with every single one of their friends standing around them."

"A-ha! *Social obligation*. The original." He smiled and continued to write illegible marks on the board from that awkward upside-down angle, as if proving a point. "Does your Dad have friends that go to the gym?"

"No--they just watch sports and drink Fanta. It's all they've ever done."

"How about the time of the year when he tries to go to the gym? Do they support him?"

"Well, no, they make fun of him every year."

"See!? See!?" Max shook the marker in her direction, a manic grin spreading across his face. "*Why*, and I mean literally *why*, would your Dad *ever* go to the gym?"

"...because he wants to get fit."

"*Wrong*. Nobody *ever* does *anything* *purely* by reasoning about long-term rewards." He looked her up and down suspiciously. "Well, remains to be seen. But for *everyone else*, absolutely not."
